# in _query_terms and the unfiltered find_node path keep an English "die"/"hat"

    Prevents high-frequency noise terms (error, exception) from stealing seed
    slots from a dominant identifier match. When FooBarService scores 1000 and
    error nodes score 1.0, only FooBarService is seeded — the score gap is 99.9%
    which is well above the 20% threshold that would allow additional seeds.

    That same gap_ratio cutoff has a failure mode on multi-term natural-language
    queries: if one term happens to hit an EXACT label match on a node that is
    otherwise unrelated to the query's intent (e.g. a common word that is also
    used as an unrelated identifier or field name elsewhere in the corpus), it
    can outscore every SUBSTRING match on the query's other, actually-relevant
    terms by ~1000x (see `_EXACT_MATCH_BONUS` vs. `_SUBSTRING_MATCH_BONUS`).
    The 20%-gap cutoff then silently discards all of those substring-tier
    seeds, so the BFS traversal only ever explores the neighborhood of the one
    unrelated exact match — see #1445.

    When `G` and `best_seed_by_term` are supplied, this guarantees at least one
    seed per distinct query term that has any match at all, so one term's
    incidental collision cannot starve out the others. The per-token winners
    in `best_seed_by_term` are precomputed by `_score_query` (during the same
    traversal that produced `scored`) so this function no longer rescores the
    graph per term — see #1445 and the `_score_query` docstring.

    Coverage scaling in _score_nodes (#1602) now dampens a lone collision's
    exact tier on multi-term queries, which brings label-matching relevant
    nodes back inside the gap window; this per-term guarantee remains
    load-bearing for relevant nodes matched only via substrings, whose flat
    scores a dampened collision can still exceed.

    Both traversals only record an edge that *discovers* an unvisited neighbour,
    so what they return is a traversal tree, not the induced subgraph over the
    nodes they return. `_bfs` marks every seed visited up front, so an edge
    between two seeds can never be recorded — the reported symptom, where both
    endpoints render and the edge between them does not. It drops ordinary
    cross-edges for the same reason. `_dfs` appends on push rather than on
    visit, so it already captured those; its one gap is an edge between two
    non-seed hubs, since neither endpoint is ever expanded.

    Scans only edges incident to `visited`, so cost tracks the subgraph rather
    than the whole graph, bounded by O(2E) overall. A visited hub is rescanned
    in full even though the traversal deliberately did not expand it — that is
    unavoidable, since a hub-to-hub edge is exactly the case `_dfs` misses.
    `G` here is the context-filtered `traversal_graph` (see
    `_query_graph_text`), so a filtered-out relation cannot reappear.

    Self-loops are skipped. A recursive function legitimately carries one, but
    neither traversal has ever recorded one (`n` is always already visited when
    its own self-loop is examined), and surfacing them is a separate output
    change from the missing edges reported here.

    Dedup keys on the ordered pair for directed graphs and the unordered pair
    otherwise: on a DiGraph `u->v` and `v->u` are genuinely distinct edges
    (mutual recursion, circular imports), and collapsing them would drop a real
    one. On a multigraph parallel edges collapse to one entry, matching the
